Dear iHorizon Representative,

I am writing to inform you that I have completed the Pokemon assignment for iHorizons. To run the app, please set up the React Native environment by following this URL: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup. After that, download the repository and run yarn install or npm install in the root directory. If you are running the app on an iOS device, please run cd ios && pod install, but this step is not required for Android devices. Finally, run npx react-native run-ios or npx react-native run-android.

During this assignment, I achieved several milestones that I would like to highlight. First, the complete project was built using TypeScript, and the code is reusable. Second, I used React Native CLI to start the project, and managed two or three design patterns at different places. Third, since the app requires that the store should be persistent, I ensured that pagination and Pokemon details are fully catered to. Moreover, the code is well-written and readable.

To implement the assignment, I used Redux Toolkit along with RTKQuery, and the behavior of Pokemon details is such that if a Pokemon is already saved, we won't make another network call for the same Pokemon since it is already fetched, and this API is constant so it won't impact. I intentionally kept this behavior.

Although the UI was not the main focus since the application was not UI-intensive, I tried to manage more fancy things on the implementation side. In case of any concerns or queries, I would be glad to answer them over a call. If you find any issues regarding anything, please give me a chance to explain my position.

Due to my busy routine, I couldn't manage to complete all the test cases.

I tried to acheive this assignment very near to 100%

Thank you for giving me this opportunity, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Soban Arshad
